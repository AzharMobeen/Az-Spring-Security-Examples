# Simple Spring Security Example (1st Example)

* Just add Spring security maven dependency it will automatically apply spring security authentication and authorization to all the uri's.
* you can login with default username and password user/(when you run application password will be generated in console)
* Hit this url [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)
* Enter username as *user and password copy from console.
* we can change default username and password by adding into property file and then spring security will not generate password.
* I have already change username and password in property file just uncomment and run application.
* Try with changed username and password.

## Next Example:
* [In second example I will use inMemory List of users for spring security.](/InMemory-spring-security)
